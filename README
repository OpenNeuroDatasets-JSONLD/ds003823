Heart Rate Variability and Emotion Regulation (HRV-ER)

Previous research suggests that heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback aimed at increasing HRV can reduce anxiety and stress. The current project investigated the brain mechanisms underlying these effects, with the primary hypothesis being that inducing high amplitude heart rate oscillations via slow paced breathing and HRV biofeedback would increase functional connectivity within brain emotion-related networks, including between amygdala and mPFC. The effects of two 5-weeks interventions were compared: 1) Increase-Oscillations (Osc+), in which participants completed two daily sessions involving slow paced breathing and HRV biofeedback aimed at increasing heart rate oscillation; 2) Decrease-Oscillations (Osc-), in which participants completed two daily sessions involving individualized strategies and HRV biofeedback aimed at decreasing heart rate oscillation.

Mechanism 1: engaging prefrontal control over heart rate is the critical factor that allows HRV biofeedback to help improve well-being. In this case, well-being should increase over time in both groups, as both training should engage prefrontal cortex to implement self-directed control over heart rate. Strengthening prefrontal control mechanisms may help improve emotion regulation in everyday life.
Mechanism 2: increased HRV during the training sessions leads to greater functional connectivity among brain regions associated with emotion regulation during the high HRV state. In this case, improved well-being would be specifically associated with having time each day during which there were very high HRV states, and so improved well-being should be seen only in the group in which participants get biofeedback to increase HRV.
